Work in Progress   

Please see https://andrekramermsc.substack.com/p/n-versioning-ai-llm-models   

Query multiple LLMs and compare results to suppress model errors.   
The models to use and comparison action are configurable.  
2-way and 3-way comparisons are possible.  

Usage:  
python3 multi-llm.py 3-way|2-way prompt

e.g.  
python3 multi-llm.py 3-way "Who wrote The Great Gabsby?"
